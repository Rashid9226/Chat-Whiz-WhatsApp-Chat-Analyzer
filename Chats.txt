10/06/24, 11:07 pm - +234 905 681 3443: Hello guys 
Please has she shared her notes yet?
10/06/24, 11:18 pm - +234 803 094 4021: No

She said it is after the 3rd LCS before she will share it
10/06/24, 11:22 pm - +234 905 681 3443: Okay
Thank you @2348030944021
10/06/24, 11:58 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Why's she always keeping the notebook untill the last class?

This is why some of us find it difficult to submit the attachments. She's giving us only 2 days to round off and write the projects?

I really don't understand this...
11/06/24, 12:01 am - +234 806 208 7478: Same here too  ..please let us plead with her that some of us need yo practice before the assignments 🙏🏽
11/06/24, 12:36 am - +234 706 500 0149: Honestly, this pattern has made it difficult for us to internalize the lessons/materials since the later part of this internship.

Other tracks have their codes ready even before they've commenced any Stage, allowing them ample time to practice and try out things.

What happened with releasing the datasets, at least, if we can't have the codes? 

This pattern has made the later part of this internship boring and becoming uninteresting, tbh😒
11/06/24, 12:43 am - +234 905 681 3443: It's sad really
11/06/24, 12:46 am - +234 706 500 0149: Maybe we've become kids <This message was edited>
11/06/24, 11:30 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Dear Hamoye HQ,

Thank you for the unique learning opportunity that you provided us through this internship. I believe I speak the mind of most of us when I say this program is intensive, well structured and fully worth every stress that goes with it. Going forward, I  wish to plead with you to look into a key challenge that the Data Storytelling track interns have grappled with so far.

The materials for the Stages have consistently arrived very late, particularly since the Stage C of this internship, which have affected our performances. For instance, the codes/datasets have arrived just 3 days to the deadline of the stages. Consequently, we have started these stages roughly just 3 days to the end of the stages/deadline. It's significantly resulted in  us missing out on the crucial time and opportunity to practice and really understand the contents of these stages, and has given us less time to carry out the project associated with each of the stages. we are not entitled to any of these materials, but I believe that addressing this issue would help Hamoye in meeting her core objectives, improve participation, as well as interns' overall experience. On a hindsight, a continued drop in performance typically dampens determination and could discourage affected interns from continuing.

While we're very dedicated with the Hamoye program, a good number of us still juggle this internship with work or other responsibilities, and 3 days seems not ideal to facilitate a proper learning experience.

I would be most grateful if this can be addressed, to partly remedy the impact on our ongoing Stage, E.
11/06/24, 11:31 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Wanted to post this on our Slack channel, but I wanted you guys help me look at it, and let me know what you think
11/06/24, 11:32 pm - +234 706 500 0149: I don't want to sound like it's a rebellion, but I feel this has become necessary.
11/06/24, 11:46 pm - +234 816 090 2801: Hmmm, This internship ends in 8 days or so not really necessary at this point.
11/06/24, 11:47 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Do you this this is a problem from the tutor?
11/06/24, 11:58 pm - +44 7947 652256: If you post this, I would support your post with a comment. 

This is not just for us. What about others after us.

Would be great to get things fixed and not ignore because it won’t affect us.
12/06/24, 12:00 am - +234 806 208 7478: Me too
12/06/24, 12:07 am - +234 905 681 3443: I think it should be addressed, because even Data science track have the same issue and it will affect Hamoye too

Imagine not understanding anything until the last days of submission. After 2 weeks. You end up missing submission deadlines
12/06/24, 12:09 am - +234 905 681 3443: You can reference that because the quiz doesn't involve the datasets we pass it but tag alongs codes are being affected. I'm sure they can see that from the drop in performance
12/06/24, 12:13 am - +234 706 500 0149: Are you sure that Data Science track are having the same problem?
12/06/24, 12:14 am - +234 706 500 0149: Secondly, do you think this is a problem from the tutor? I thate case, she'll feel unbalanced with this post
12/06/24, 12:15 am - +234 706 500 0149: The worst, u won't have the opportunity to understand anything, then voom you're in a new stage, piling up the confusion
12/06/24, 12:15 am - +234 905 681 3443: Yes
They complain about understanding the flow
But I can't 100% say it's because of not sharing the notes on time
12/06/24, 12:15 am - +234 706 500 0149: I think that's contributed in my dropped interest in the internship so far
12/06/24, 12:17 am - +234 905 681 3443: I think she explains it well
But I haven't watched other tracks LCS🤔
I think that would provide insight...on if its a tutor issue
12/06/24, 12:18 am - +234 706 500 0149: I meant if it's the tutor who's delaying the materials
12/06/24, 12:19 am - +234 706 500 0149: Since most of us support this, I'm going to go ahead and post the request, anyway!
12/06/24, 12:30 am - +234 706 500 0149: One final thing, does any line in the piece not appear polite

I want it to appear as polite as possible. No entitlement, no disrespect.
12/06/24, 3:29 pm - +234 816 405 7432: I think it's Hamoye issue. It's not the tutor issue.
12/06/24, 3:32 pm - +234 703 104 8544: The tutor is part of Hamoye; making it a collective issue
12/06/24, 3:34 pm - +234 816 405 7432: Yeah. I agree with you
12/06/24, 3:34 pm - +234 816 405 7432: But I think dropping the note late is an instruction from Hamoye.
12/06/24, 3:35 pm - +234 816 405 7432: I remember there was a time she was asking the Hamoye admin (that Mercy lady) if she could drop the note for us in one of the classes. <This message was edited>

14/06/24, 8:18 pm - +234 905 681 3443: Do we choose btw the Coca-Cola or amazon dataset for this project?
or both
14/06/24, 8:19 pm - +234 816 405 7432: The former. Just one of them
14/06/24, 8:20 pm - +234 905 681 3443: Okay thank you🙂 @2348164057432 
Coca-Cola is an interesting challenge
14/06/24, 8:21 pm - +234 816 405 7432: I think so too. But it depends on interest
14/06/24, 8:47 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Is this real?
14/06/24, 8:48 pm - +234 706 500 0149: We had LCS yesterday. Today again?
14/06/24, 8:48 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Personally thought this was sent on our slack channel in error🙄🤔 <This message was edited>
14/06/24, 8:54 pm - +234 905 681 3443: Yes
It's because of the public holiday next week. Atleast it gives time to practice @2347065000149
14/06/24, 8:54 pm - +234 905 681 3443: I hope she shares the notebook quicker...I got logged out during the meeting
14/06/24, 8:59 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Omo, I'm already feeling tired of this internship. I can't wait to get the hell over this stuff 😒
14/06/24, 9:00 pm - +234 706 500 0149: When's the deadline for this Stage E?
14/06/24, 9:01 pm - +234 905 681 3443: Tuesday still
14/06/24, 9:02 pm - +234 703 104 8544: Pls has she dropped the notebook
14/06/24, 9:03 pm - +234 816 405 7432: She did not promise to drop the notebook
14/06/24, 9:03 pm - +234 816 405 7432: We can ask her for it though.
14/06/24, 9:03 pm - +234 703 104 8544: 😮
14/06/24, 9:04 pm - +234 706 500 0149: I messaged her privately over my complaints two days ago. Though the message format was wholey different. While appreciating my feedback, she replied to me that she's going to share the notebook yesterday.

Are you sure she didn't share it? <This message was edited>
14/06/24, 9:05 pm - +234 905 681 3443: She added new things today
But I'm curious to know if she did
I wasn't in yesterday's class
14/06/24, 9:05 pm - +234 816 405 7432: Yes. She didn’t say anything about dropping the notebook
14/06/24, 9:06 pm - +234 816 405 7432: We can ask sha. She might have forgotten.
14/06/24, 9:07 pm - +234 816 405 7432: Yeah. The Coca Cola part basically. Just to give a lead on the work
14/06/24, 9:07 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Mercy, I put it on you to please ask on our behalves 😄
14/06/24, 9:09 pm - +234 816 405 7432: Done
14/06/24, 9:09 pm - +234 816 405 7432: Please let’s monitor her response and if she drops it.
14/06/24, 9:18 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Thank you, Mercy 🙏
14/06/24, 9:43 pm - +234 816 405 7432: She said she can’t drop the notebook
14/06/24, 9:43 pm - +234 816 405 7432: We are advised to check YouTube
14/06/24, 9:44 pm - +234 905 681 3443: Wow!
14/06/24, 10:42 pm - +234 706 500 0149: 😭😭😭
14/06/24, 10:43 pm - +234 706 500 0149: But some of the work do not appear clear on YouTube?🤔 I meant viewing
14/06/24, 10:46 pm - +234 816 723 9419: Why not increase your resolution
14/06/24, 10:46 pm - +234 816 723 9419: Please when is is the deadline for submission
14/06/24, 10:48 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Huh...Like you're done?

14/06/24, 10:48 pm - +234 816 723 9419: What day does it fall on
14/06/24, 10:49 pm - +234 816 723 9419: I missed all the classes
15/06/24, 8:10 pm - +234 706 500 0149: https://forms.gle/uLZuytACQp6XP3NV9
15/06/24, 8:10 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Keyword: upgrade
15/06/24, 8:10 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Guys, act on this 👆
15/06/24, 8:11 pm - +234 905 681 3443: Thanks a lot!
16/06/24, 8:56 pm - +234 706 500 0149: I just calculated this... So this internship is closing on Tuesday? 

And Tuesday, being *June 18,* is the last day for the *Stage E?*🤔🙄
16/06/24, 8:57 pm - +256 781 299662: Shall we have access to the reading materials
16/06/24, 8:57 pm - +234 706 500 0149: What do you mean?
16/06/24, 8:58 pm - +256 781 299662: The course
16/06/24, 8:59 pm - +234 706 500 0149: When the program closes, we lose access to the materials just the same way we don't normally have access to them until the links for the Stages are shared to us
16/06/24, 9:00 pm - +256 781 299662: Even the ones we have completed
16/06/24, 9:01 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Once u accepted any Stage, the preceding Stage disappeared from your course tray. Haven't u noticed that?
16/06/24, 9:02 pm - +256 781 299662: There is ongoing and completed
16/06/24, 9:03 pm - +256 781 299662: When it disappears it goes to completed
16/06/24, 9:03 pm - +256 781 299662: U can nolonger submit the quiz
16/06/24, 9:03 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Do you still have access to the past Stages? Even if in the "Completed Courses?"
16/06/24, 9:03 pm - +256 781 299662: Yes
16/06/24, 9:04 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Okay, that means the access will remain
16/06/24, 9:04 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Like u said, no more quiz once closed.

And they actually need the traffics
16/06/24, 9:04 pm - +256 781 299662: Correct
16/06/24, 9:05 pm - +234 706 500 0149: So, is it Coca-Cola that we're working on for the project?
17/06/24, 1:49 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Anyone here able to create API authentication on that developer movie website that our tutor used?
17/06/24, 1:49 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Good morning all
17/06/24, 10:23 pm - +234 816 405 7432: Please who has done the quiz?

18/06/24, 5:43 pm - +234 905 681 3443: Hi guys

18/06/24, 6:55 pm - +234 816 405 7432: Coca Cola website is static
18/06/24, 7:08 pm - +234 905 681 3443: Oh Thanks

18/06/24, 7:16 pm - +234 816 405 7432: She didn’t share the third one
18/06/24, 7:16 pm - +234 816 405 7432: You can check it on YouTube
18/06/24, 7:16 pm - +234 706 500 0149: Okay, thanks
18/06/24, 7:18 pm - +234 706 500 0149: But that second one on Amazon isn't complete?
18/06/24, 7:19 pm - +234 706 500 0149: I think she stopped at the Preprocessing 1 to 5?
03/08/24, 8:46 pm - +234 905 681 3443: Hi guys,

Also, to send in our LinkedIn profiles and have us endorse each others skills. <This message was edited>
