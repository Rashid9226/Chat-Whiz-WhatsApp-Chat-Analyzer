For instance, the codes/datasets have arrived just 3 days to the deadline of the stages. Consequently, we have started these stages roughly just 3 days to the end of the stages/deadline. It's significantly resulted in  us missing out on the crucial time and opportunity to practice and really understand the contents of these stages, and has given us less time to carry out the project associated with each of the stages. we are not entitled to any of these materials, but I believe that addressing this issue would help Hamoye in meeting her core objectives, improve participation, as well as interns' overall experience.
